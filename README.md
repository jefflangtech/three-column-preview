## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Step by step

Total time: 9:16

1. Initial setup (0:25)
2. Design system (0:17)
3. Notes on the layout (0:34)

**Notes**
It looks like the overall layout of the widget is broken into 3 primary sections, and each one of them can be their own div. Perhaps one is the header, which will contain the request for feedback heading prior to submission, and then the confirmation image after submission. Then a message div, and the rating div.

In the request state everything is either left aligned or spaced evenly, and the rating div can be flex. In the thank you state the content is centered.

For mobile everything is sized down a little bit but the overall layout stays the same so it should be really straight-forward to make this work.

The star and the rating selectors, 1-5, exist inside the same type of circular container. The only difference would be that the rating selectors have a hover state and a selected state. It looks like the 'selected' state is supposed to be grey and the hover state is orange. I think what I might do is have an inactive class and an activated class, where the inactive class has a hover state while the activated class does not, and each one of those has the correct corresponding color schemes. Then, on click, its just a class toggle while the rating score itself can be stored elsewhere.

As far as the form itself, I wonder if I just use an existing HTML structure with all the styling removed so that it exists behind the scenes? I think semantically that makes the most sense so I'll probably do radio buttons...yep I'm implementing that with a submit input as well.

Let's see if any of this backfires later 😂

4. Basic layout with styles (1:20)
  - Planning this all out in advance worked so well. Also using an image overlay of the design as a layer to compare against (I just turned it off and on using a visibility rule) was critical to getting close to pixel perfect
5. Create form and styles (0:33)
6. Program form functionality (3:34)
7. Program form response content creation (2:37)
8. Responsive media queries (0:18)
9. Validation checks & readme updates (0:36)


Some fun little functionality to add a new element to the DOM with some optional attributes

```js
// Function to create new elements in the dom, with optional attributes
// and append the new element to a specified parent
const createNewElement = function(el, parentEl, options={}) {

  const newEl = document.createElement(el);

  let elKeys = Object.keys(options);

  if(elKeys.length > 0) {

    for(let k = 0; k < elKeys.length; k++) {
      newEl.setAttribute(String(elKeys[k]), String(options[elKeys[k]]));
    }

  }

  parentEl.appendChild(newEl);

  return newEl;

};
```

### Continued development

I'm getting closer to the point where I'll want to invest some time into a framework. Now that I am understanding how things are running under the hood, so to speak, by learning things the old-fashioned-vanilla-js way, I am much clearer on the value that frameworks provide.

I am also tempted to start working on my own framework...just because it would be fun, and I also presume it would be an incredible learning experience.
